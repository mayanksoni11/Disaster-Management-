#Disaster Prediction – Management

This app is aimed for NDMA(National Disaster Management Authority) to be used to predict and prevent a natural disaster like flood in flood prone areas, landslide, eathquakes etc. And to manage the rescue effort during the course of the said disaster. The app will be used and maintained by the NDMA. It will be fed information like demographic, epidemiological patterns of the affected area. Central Database maintained by the NDMA will contain all the names and addresses of essential personnel with abilities to help the general public during the time of the disaster. They will also maintain the inventory and relief package needed during the disaster. The Volunteers will then keep the inventory of the packages, medicines send through them and constantly update it in the database. Volunteers will be provided information for people in need nearby and how they can help them. An emergency SAT phone will be present with them so as to maintain communication channels open during a complete network loss.
